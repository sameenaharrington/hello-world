# hello-world
I am new to this and want to give this a go so I can work code on my own and not have to google the problem!
:)

Please be kind...

I have a wordpress woo commerce and WCMP marketplace and need to customise the WC_New_Order email
I want to hide the customer email address and phone number. From my limited understanding I belive I need to get these details into the email and then hide them.

I want to use this space to be able to learn and collaborate.

Not sure if this is what I am even meant to write here... Oh and I love taco's too! Who doesn't!
